# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-10-17

Tab Stash is a browser extension that helps you save tabs to read later. It works entirely on your device.

## What We Collect
- We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.
- The extension does not use analytics, cookies, or remote logging.

## Data Stored Locally
- Saved items (URLs, titles, status, tags, timestamps) are stored only in your browser using IndexedDB and chrome.storage.local.
- Data never leaves your device unless you export it (TXT/CSV) or back it up yourself.

## Permissions
- `tabs`: read the current tab’s URL/title to save or reopen it.
- `storage`: store your settings and saved items locally.
- `sidePanel`: show the optional Side Panel UI.

## Security
- All processing happens locally within your browser’s extension sandbox.
- No external servers are contacted by the extension.

## Your Choices
- Import/Export: export to TXT/CSV and import from CSV via the Dashboard.
- Delete: change status to Trashed or permanently delete items at any time.
- Uninstall: removing the extension removes access to your data. You can also clear its IndexedDB and chrome.storage.local in browser settings.

## Changes
- If this policy changes, the version will be updated and the policy will be published in the repository and store listing.
